PHPFormMail
===========
A PHP form to email gateway that was a port of the even older Perl version. This
version includes some enhancements as well as spam prevention.

Please note, this is an old script from a long time ago. The net and web
programming has changed quite a bit since then. I maintain this script for
people who still want to use one from a bygone era. I no longer add new features
to it aside from security updates and trying to keep up with the latest version
of PHP.
